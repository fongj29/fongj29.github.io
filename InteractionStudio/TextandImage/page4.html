  <title>What's Alt Text</title>
</head>

<body alt="This page explains the importance of alt text. It has the same picture as the previous page but alt text overlays it in a visible paragraph style.">
  <p class="altdesc"> &ldquo;Alt text is a written description of an image posted online. Alt text allows visual content to be accessible to people who are blind, low vision, or have certain cognitive disabilities.&rdquo; <em><a href="https://alt-text-as-poetry.net/">Resource: Alt Text as Poetry</a></em>&ensp;
    In case, you&rsquo;ve never encountered alt text, here are the code snippets of how to add a photo and include alt text. Effective alt text is able to describe what is on the page and will be read aloud with a <em><a href="https://webaim.org/articles/voiceover/">voiceover</a></em>.  
    In my case, I chose to embed my own audio clips as a voiceover to avoid the robotic monotone voice that would otherwise be used.</p>

When taking sunset pics however, a cloudy day is not your enemy. Captured on the clouds are the pinks of flamingoes, the orange from a ripe tangerine, and cool blues of a refreshing pool in the summer."> </p>

This was in 2021, a bit after COVID, so we didn't go out much. However, I asked my dad if I could learn to take pictures and since he's a professional Hawai'i wedding photographer, he took me to one of his spots and set up my camera for me. We took turns shooting, so I'm not sure who took this pic. He will probably say that he did, but there's no way to prove it. The horizon isn't perfectly straight, so I might've taken the picture, actually."></p>

Coincidentally, my dad an I also happened to take the same photo of us stepping across a similar tide pool."></p>
