    <img src="imgs/sunset-sun2.png" alt="This photo was taken during the time that my dad and I went to the beach about 3 years ago. This was in 2021, a bit after COVID, so we didn't go out much. However, I asked my dad if I could learn to take pictures and since he's a professional Hawai'i wedding photographer, he took me to one of his spots and set up my camera for me. We took turns shooting, so I'm not sure who took this pic. He will probably say that he did, but there's no way to prove it. The horizon isn't perfectly straight, so I might've taken the picture, actually.">
    <img src="imgs/sunset-waves2.png" alt="&rsquo;Never turn your back on the ocean&rsquo; is a famous saying amongst the locals here. We were always taught to be aware of the waves since it is Hawaiian culture to respect the ocean's power and to be safe and cautious to avoid being swept away.">
    <img src="imgs/sunset-rocks2.png" alt="This beach is fairly known amongst Hawai'i photographers and it turns out that Justin Bieber had posted a picture at a similar looking beach jumping over tide pools on the same day as my dad and I were there. Coincidentally, my dad an I also happened to take the same photo of us stepping across a similar tide pool.">
