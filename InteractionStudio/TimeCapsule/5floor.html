<p class="description">Image of an open table on the 5th floor in the University Center. A modern white table is placed against a gray wall filled with posters. 4 black stoic chairs are placed around. A new charging station was added with the 3 main cables that you would need. Don't ask me the names. USBC? People will often leave their tech charging there since the cords are short if you ever need a free iPad. /joke
    <br><br>Food friendly. Sometimes loud, depends on how the fashion students are feeling. Seats are often taken. Most spot I get asked for surveys. Near a procolor printer that I'd like to gatekeep so I'm telling you it's junk. This area does not receive direct sunlight. Near a 3/5 bathroom. 1 minute walk to the nearest water bottle refilling station.</p><br>
