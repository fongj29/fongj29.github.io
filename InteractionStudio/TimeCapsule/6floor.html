<p class="description">Image of the (technically) 7th floor in the University Center. At least 8 modern, light yellow wood tables line the top floor. Sturdy wooden chairs with arm rests that connect to become the backrest are pushed under the tables. They also conveniently happen to be the University's loudest chairs possible. I'd say they are uncomfortable but definitely a step above the nightmarish studio stools. Three lamps sit on each table so make sure to find an open spot as the sun goes down so you get your own burst of light to keep you warm in this sometimes cold library.
    <br><br>Incredibly quiet place... unless it's 30 minutes before closing and the student workers are making it a point to push in the chairs as loud as possible so you leave. 
            If a medical student designed a library, this would be it. I can't tell what's brighter, the glaring of the white floors, or the bright futures of the students hard at work. The sparse notes of wood offer a warmer tone. Snag a couch by the windows and enjoy some sunlight and views of the green roof. You can only dream of touching grass, however, because no one is allowed outside.
    <br><br>Reliably quiet. Even offers a dedicated quiet room. And a possibly haunted bathroom. The couches feel like bricks but I've fallen asleep there 3 out of 3 times. No art supplies, food, drinks, or phone calls allowed. Cheapest B&W printer with staplers!</p>
