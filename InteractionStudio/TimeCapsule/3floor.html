<p class="description">This might just be another classroom to you. With its uniform white tables and black stoic chairs, this room happens to be the one of 2 rooms on this floor with these chairs. The others have the painful stools. Drink it all in. This is as good as it gets. A double window at the back of the room faces towards 5th ave, but wait! It doesn't actually show outside, but rather the exterior window. Beyond your window is still the interior of the school. But hey, at least you can say that your class has that NYC street view that everyone wants.  
  <br><br>Food friendly. Seats are often taken and there are classes here. The only spot I've blasted my music. Closest printer is on the 4th floor unless you can break into the faculty lounge that sits tauntingly on this floor. Does not receive direct sunlight. Though this is the hardest floor to navigate, once you find the bathrooms, you won't regret the journey. 4.9/5 and always smells good.</p><br>
