<p class="description">Image of the 4th floor printing station! Please don't go here 10 minutes before your project is due. Every printer will break and most of the IT staff will not be able to help you with trying to print from InDesign. (Only print from Adobe Acrobat they say.) Plotters are more reliable. All of the table areas are cutting mats and this is the only place in the UC you should be cutting. Stop scratching up all the desks, bro. 
  <br><br>Food friendly. Only loud right before class time. Seats are sometimes taken. Only spot you'll find a CD student in the UC. Be nice to the printers and they will sometimes be nice to you. Does not receive direct sunlight at all. Near a 3/5 bathroom.</p><br>
