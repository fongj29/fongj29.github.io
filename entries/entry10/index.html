        Dear Parents,
        <br />
        <br />
        This week was crazyyy. The 11th of November was Veterans Day, but we didn’t have that Friday off since we went
        to Open Plans (see previous entry). That weekend was no break for me as I had to spit out a mockup for my final
        book project. I was only able to get out one half, if that. <br />
        <br />
        My roommate had a basketball game that I said I would go to on Saturday... until I found out that it was in Long
        Island and took 2 hours to get there. They also ended up staying there the whole day. She was sad that I backed
        out but I said that I had to make a mockup of my book, so I had to stick to that promise. I found that very
        motivating and I was able to stick to my word.
        <br />
        <br />
        As Sunday bled into Monday, I worked on the newspaper so much that I stayed up multiple times til 5 or 6am.
        Monday was hectic since I also had a long club meeting for the event pictured here. We also were trying to print
        mockups of newspapers but that was a whole ordeal since the printers were all whack.
        <br />
        <br />
        Tuesday came and I had stayed up til 5 again. I worked on a quick essay for my Thursday class in the morning. I
        had a design competition at 5 and would miss coding class. I worked on refining my coding project and spent
        hours unwinding what I had.
        <br />
        <br />I worked on the newspaper more but then had to go to the design competition in Tribeca. It was a great
        experience but my team was not strong. I was able to meet students from the exact major I was looking into from
        FIT AND their program director. My professor and our Interior design director was also there. I met the director
        before when I discussed changing majors and she asked me for any updates. I mentioned looking into FIT and they
        immediately were like noo, you have to stay here.
        <br />
        <br />
        Wednesday I also had my final presentation for my elective, Inclusive Retail. My presentation wasn’t as strong
        since I only had a bit of Sunday to refine it and I had wanted to teach myself how to render in order to truly
        present my retail experience well. The interior design program director was also there and watched me present...
        In my newspaper class, my print editor and I got flamed for each technical detail in our designs. I had to skip
        studio class at 7 and spent the rest of the night trying to stay up to work on the newspaper since it was being
        sent to print the next day.
        <br />
        <br />
        Thursday and Friday were less hectic but I also had to do a lot of work to prepare for the next day. It truly is
        hard to stay afloat here. Saturday was the day of this event! Panel to Party, sounds so fun! My club, AIGA@TNS
        organized an internship panel of students and we had a student <br />
        mixer after. I picked up the pizza from my fave, Champion Pizza and took notes, as well.
        <br />
        <br />
        Overall insane week, and I especially learned a lot about working in teams.
