            Dear Parents,
            <br />
            <br />
            I went to my first fashion show this week! My roommate, Kiki, had texted me on Monday about a fashion show
that her friend was putting on. I didn’t look too into it but I agreed to go with her since it was a Friday
night and I had nothing else planned. She later told me that the event was red black and white themed so we each
looked for outfits the day before lol. I ended up getting a red top from a thrift store and she wore a black
dress. It was fun getting ready together since she offered to do my hair and had this hair curling thing that
could curl my hair for me.
<br />
<br />
We honestly got to the fashion show kind of late since doors opened at 8, but since it said it started at 8:30,
Kiki suggested we leave at 8:10 since it was only a few minutes away. We went up a ritchety elevator and when we
arrived on the floor, there was only a sign for an art studio. We opened the door and it was the backstage - all
the models were getting ready to go out on the runway; the designers were rushing around and doing the last
touchups. It was like a stereotypical nightmare. Kiki luckily spotted her friend who was running the thing and
she rushed us through the curtain and to the actual runway area. There was a good chunk of people, mainly
Chinese, a few that Kiki recognized. <br><br>
The show started shortly after and I took my camera out... the lights went out and I was trying to autofocus. I
didn’t realize that by doing this in the dark, my camera shoots a dull white light which was pretty obvious
since it was pitch black. Rookie mistake. But the curtain also dropped right before the models were supposed to
walk through sooo.
<br />
<br />I had a good angle of the models but there was this guy right in front of me taking up the most space
possible just to film the thing on his phone. But I looked at his screen throughout the show, and after the
first 5 minutes, the video was getting crooked because he wasn’t paying attention. I was only going to take a
few pics but the people next to me were irritating me with their plastic disposable cams and a whole plastic
polaroid. Good stuff. I think the better photographers were in the middle under the main light because i saw
their big lens. I wonder how their photos turned out. Kiki was next to me so I was showing her some of my photos
throughout the show and she was hyping them up so that probably also gave me a confident boost.
<br />
<br />
It was an overall great time and I’m glad I got to go and get crazy shadows without having to use and figure out external flash and stuff.
