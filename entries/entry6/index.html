        Dear Parents,
        <br>
        <br>
This week Wyland came into town since he was on Fall Break and was staying in Queens with another friend. We
went to the Met Fest on Saturday which is this annual day of activities put on by the Metropolitan Museum of
Art. There were supposed to be free activities outdoors, but they had moved it inside because of the light rain
in the morning. Everything and everyone was smushed inside, so walking around felt like a bustling Costco..
After we walked around, we noticed that a lot of the activities were for small kids or were closed for some
reason. We even tried to go to an art show on the roof garden but a worker said the garden was closed. Bit of a
disappointment so we left and ate pizza and meandered around the Upper West Side.
    </p></div>
