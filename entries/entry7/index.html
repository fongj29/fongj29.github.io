        Dear Parents,
        <br>
        <br>
        Ever heard of Smooth Technology? I definitely didn’t before this week. They are a team of four? people that
        combine art and engineer to accomplish crazy feats. Their first emerging project was the iconic neon lights for
        Taylor Swift’s 1989 World Tour. That project really put them on the map and have since worked with big names
        like Katy Perry, Nicki Minaj, Billy Porter, and more. We were all blown away by their extensive organizational
        system since as engineers, they have to work with physical pieces to create prototypes in short timespans. They
        also shared how sometimes they don’t make that big of a profit since there are a lot of unfactored costs that
        come with big projects. They try to never turn down a company to avoid losing that contact. <br />
        <br>
        We also visited Gumbo Collective, a communal working space for game designers. They invited us into their space
        and we were able to sit in their lounge area, a very cozy place with deep couches, warm baths of light, and
        games everywhere. We learned the power of community
        and how developers were able to find a community in an otherwise isolated job.
