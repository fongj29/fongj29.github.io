          Dear Parents,
          <br />
          <br />
          This week we visited Open Plans, a nonprofit organization that. advocates for activating the streets of NYC.
          This basically means finding new ways to bring street spaces back to the people rather than cars. Of course,
          this is a headache to drivers who already struggle to get around in the congested streets. However, they found
          that by utilizing street space, they can garner a sense of community since in New York, there arenâ€™t much open,
          communal spaces.
          <br />
          <br />
          They showed us an example of how streets can be pedestrian only in front of schools to allow students to get
          outside, especially since a lot of the schools here have no outdoor space and literally exist in a building!
          Quite sImilar to the New School, actually.
          <br />
          <br />
          As soon as we got onto their floor, we were immediately greeted by plants galore. The space was incredibly
          decorated with East Asian pieces and every inch was thought out. They even offered us snacks! Open Plans is a
          great example of how people can do amazing work for
          the benefit of their community and treat their workers well to create a safe,
          encouraging environment.</p>
