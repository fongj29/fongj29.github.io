        On Friday, September 22nd, we went to Cooper Hewitt Design Museum. For some reason, I only looked at the Cooper part so I was expecting it to be part of the Cooper Union campus. Instead, it was actually a museum, part of the Smithsonian program.
        <br><br>
        This museum was especially noteworthy because it was able to incorporate a lot of interactive elements. There were lightboxes where you could trace symbols then pin it on the wall. They also had an emoji wall where you could place emoji cutouts in categories on the wall to show what you were feeling today.
